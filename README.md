# Scott Logic Swift Study Group

This repo contains projects developed for the Scott Logic Swift study group.

## Projects

### Homework-Week1.playground
- Palindromes
- FizzBuzz
- Brackets

These exercises focussed on the basics of Swift (operators, basic Swift standard library features, control flow e.t.c).

### StructFun.playground
- Structs
- Custom operators

This exercise adds custom operators to make working with CGPoints easier (point1 + point2). 

It then extends this by creating a custom type (a struct) to represent a matrix. The * operand can be used with this matrix type to multiply it by a scalar value.
