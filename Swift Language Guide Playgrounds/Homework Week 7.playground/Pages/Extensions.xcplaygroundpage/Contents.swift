//: Let's add a method to `String` that appends a happy face
extension String
{
    // As we're altering 'self' we mark this method as mutating
    mutating func appendMrHappy()
    {
        self += "ðŸ˜€" // Or could do ' self = "\(self)ðŸ˜€" '
    }
}

var happyString = "I'm feeling happy happy happy"
happyString.appendMrHappy()

//: That was just spiffing! Let's try something a bit stranger...
//: _________
//: Add dynamic proprties to convert a double into other units

    }

    var miles: Double

// Now let's try it out
let metresRan: Double = 5000
metresRan.km
metresRan.miles
metresRan.cm

//: How about passing in closures?
